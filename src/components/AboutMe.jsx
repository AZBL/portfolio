      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer with a background in the medical field. I hold
        a Master's Degree in Medical Science, and prior to transitioning to tech
        I worked as a physician assistant in the emergency department and urgent
        care settings. In many ways I've always been a tech geek, but my journey
        into software engineering began a few years ago when I discovered my
        passion for coding. I'm a graduate of Coding Temple where I completed a
        comprehensive full stack software engineering bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time with family, cooking various
        cuisines, being outside, and recently, watching 90's movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for a full time software engineering position so
        please browse my portfolio and reach out if you think I would be a fit
        for your company.
