      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring software engineer with a background in the medical
        field. I hold a Master's Degree in Medical Science and have worked as a
        physician assistant treating patients in the emergency department and
        urgent care. My journey into technology began a few years ago when I
        discovered my passion for coding. This newfound interest soon
        transformed into a determination to pursue a career in software
        engineering. Driven by this passion, I've dedicated a significant
        portion of my time to programming. I've recently completed a
        comprehensive full stack software engineering bootcamp at Coding Temple.
        While I may be new to the professional world of software engineering, I
        compensate with an unyielding desire to learn and improve. My previous
        career as a Physician Assistant honed valuable skills that will
        crossover to the tech world: strong communication, teamwork, and the
        confidence to tackle challenging problems head-on.
        {/* I
        bring these qualities to my career in software engineering, promising to
        approach each project with the same dedication and integrity that I've
        applied in healthcare. */}
